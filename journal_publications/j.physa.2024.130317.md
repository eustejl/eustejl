## Highlights
- Time-resolved pairs of country-level and respondent-level culture maps generated from
IVS data from 1981 (start of Survey Wave 1) to 2022 (end of Wave 7)...
- Relation between the mean location of the respondent distribution of a country and its
location in the cross-country map...
- Use of culture displacement vectors to track the temporal movements of the country
locations in the cross-country map...
- Countries have moved towards the self-expression direction from 1981 to 2022.
- Calculation of standard deviational ellipse (SDE) of the respondent distribution and use of SDE area to measure degree of cultural diversity of its national population...
- Countries with lower degrees of cultural diversity, i.e., smaller SDE areas, are those that
placed greater emphasis on traditional and survival values.
