## Highlights
- Explained mechanism behind perpendicular magnetic anisotropy upon hole doping in H-VTe2 monolayer based on the larger first-order spin-orbit splitting at the VBM when spins are out-of-plane
- Explained mechanism behind perpendicular magnetic anisotropy upon hole doping in H-VSe2 and H-VS2 monolayers based on the larger spin-orbit shift when spins are out-of-plane
- Identified two conditions for the PMA enhancement upon hole doping: (1) orbital degeneracy at the valence band edge and (2) finite SOC character
- Identified 21 point groups the ensure orbital degeneracies in the electronic structure
- Identified nine (9) examples of classes of materials—satisfying the said conditions—that exhibit increasing magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) upon hole doping
- Our results provide fundamental understanding of magnetic anisotropy enhancement by hole doping
- Our mechanism can serve a guiding principle for band engineering and high-throughput screening of materials for tuning magnetic anisotropy
